Grouped Data Mode Calculation (Without Using Variables)

Objective:
Write a Python program to calculate the mode of grouped data
without storing values in separate variables.

Problem Statement:
Given a grouped frequency distribution, the program should:
- Identify the modal class
- Apply the mode formula for grouped data
- Compute the final mode value directly using expressions

Constraints:
- Do not store formula components in separate variables
- Perform calculation directly inside the formula

Expected Outcome:
The program should display the calculated mode correctly.

Learning Focus:
- Mathematical logic implementation
- Expression-based calculation
- Python arithmetic operations
